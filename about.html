      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Covid-19 is a super infectious disease that has taken the world by
        storm. Information and resources pertaining to Covid-19 are constantly
        changing and developing. It is imperative for people to understand the
        risks of this disease, as well as how to protect others. The goal of
        Covid Hub is to provide a way for people to communicate and stay
        informed at the same time - an all in one hub. This is accomplished
        through up-to-date resources, a map that helps people track where Covid
        infected patients are, and a discussion board for people to talk about
        their experiences.

      <h1>Inspiration</h1>
      <p>
        We are a group of 3 college students attending the University of North
        Carolina at Chapel Hill. Our first year of college was cut short due to
        the pandemic and we were unable to return to campus for our second year.
        Some of us also have friends who have tragically lost family members. We
        are tired of the poor handling by the government and mass ignorance
        online. Therefore, we created this site to educate more people on the
        risks their actions may bring. We included a discussion board in the
        hopes for people to talk about their experiences.
